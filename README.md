# Better Thermostat

**Important Notice: This software is still in beta. When all main functions are stable there will be a 1.0 release under the new name: better_thermostat.**
**After 1.0 we switch to Monthly releases**

**Tested with: HA: 2021.12.5 and Z2M: 1.22.1-1**

**You need at least HA: 2021.12 for 0.8.2 or higher**

**NEW: if you're looking for a better thermostat UI too, check out the [better-thermostat-ui-card](https://github.com/KartoffelToby/better-thermostat-ui-card) Lovelace hacs frontend card.**

### Advance information:

- If you have a question or need help please create a new [discussion](https://github.com/KartoffelToby/better_thermostat/discussions) or check if your question is already answered.
- If you have a suggestion, found a bug, or want to add a new device or function create a new [issue](https://github.com/KartoffelToby/better_thermostat/issues)
- If you want to contribute to this project create a new [pull request](https://github.com/KartoffelToby/better_thermostat/pulls)

### Core features:

*Talke to me! What makes the better_thermostat better?*

- simplifies your TRVs modes
- makes your TRVs full compatible with Google Home
- adds a window open detection with an external open/close sensor
- adds a summer shutdown with a weather entity or outdoor temperature sensor
- adds "better" room temperature-based calibration with an external room-temperature sensor, because it works most of the time not good on the TRV.
- adds a scheduler for valve maintenance to prevent the valve to get stuck or noisy

This integration brings some smartness to your TRV Zigbee2MQTT setup.

What does it? It combines an external temperature sensor, window/door Sensors, and a weather-Entity, so your TRV is calibrated with the temperature from the external sensor and turned off if some window is open. It also turns off the thermostat if a configured outside temperature is reached for two days in a row, so if it's outside warm enough you didn't need useless heating in your rooms.

It's also useful for those who only need an off and heating state and controlled the room temperature with a set target temperature based on an external temperature sensor.

So if you use the Google Assistant integration to control your thermostat you no longer get into an issue of incompatible modes or the problem that a target temp can't be set because the device is in "auto" mode that's remapped to eco.

You just set the desired temperature with your voice or the Google Home app, and you are good to go.

At this time following models are supported: (but all zigbee2mqtt TRV should work.)

---

- Eurotronic Spirit Zigbee (SPZB0001) (In Z2M device settings, set legacy to true) **normal calibration**
- Moes SEA801-Zigbee/SEA802-Zigbee (In Z2M device settings, set legacy to true) **normal calibration**
- TuYa TS0601_thermostat (TS0601) **target temperature calibration**
- Siterwell GS361A-H04 (GS361A-H04) **target temperature calibration**
- BRT-100-TRV (In Z2M device settings, set min temp to 5 and program mode to manual) **target temperature calibration** (will be switched to normal calibration if this is fixed [issue](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/9486))

*All models that are not listed here use the default which is the **normal calibration** and expects that the TRV has system modes*

**normal calibration**: means that the local_temperature_calibration setting in the TRV is used to sync the TRV internal current temperature with the connected room temperature sensor. The target temperature is settable over HA or directly on the TRV there are no restrictions

**target temperature calibration**: This means that the temperature sync is accomplished with a special target temperature on the TRV, that's the reason why the target temperature displayed on the TRV is not the same as in HA, you only can adjust the target temperature via HA, not the TRV itself. If you want more info why, read [#15](/../../issues/15)

---

The SPZB0001 is Special, it uses the "heat" mode for boost and the auto mode for the "normal" operation, to avoid that it remaps heat with auto internally, the boost mode is lost with this configuration.

If you have a special Thermostat like the SPZB0001 feel free to open an issue or pull a request.

The integration gets the Model identifier automatic, nothing to do here.

## Important config in Zigbee2Mqtt

**IMPORTANT: be sure to enable "legacy" in Zigbee2MQTT on the TRV devices and settings if you haven't the key local_temperature_calibration in your HA instance and include_device_information in the Zigbee2MQTT MQTT settings**

If you use Z2M with the HA Supervisor, make sure you set it in the configuration. otherwise, it reset this option on every restart. [#57](/../../issues/57)

```yaml
mqtt:
  base_topic: zigbee2mqtt
  include_device_information: true
```

Switch on the global **include_device_information** under Settings > Mqtt > include_device_information.
<br>
<img src="assets/z2m_include_device_informations.png" width="900px">

Switch on the Legacy Setting in each of your TRV (if your TRV has this option, otherwise skip this step)
Make sure to disable the window detection and child protection modes, also make sure your TRV is not in a program mode

## SETUP

You need to configure a "virtual" thermostat for every used thermostat.

Here is an example of the minimal configuration.

```yaml
climate:
  - platform: better_thermostat
    name: room
    thermostat: climate.trv
    temperature_sensor: sensor.temperature
    window_sensors: group.office_windows
```

Here is an example full configuration.

```yaml
climate:
  - platform: better_thermostat
    name: room
    thermostat: climate.trv
    temperature_sensor: sensor.temperature
    window_sensors: group.office_windows # if this is not set, the window open detection is off
    weather: weather.home # if this is set, the outdoor_sensor is ignored, remove the outdoor_sensor config!
    outdoor_sensor: sensor.outdoor_temperature # if you want to use it, remove the weather entity from the config!
    off_temperature: 17.5
    window_off_delay: 15 # seconds
    valve_maintenance: false
    night_temp: 18.5
    night_start: '22:00'
    night_end: '06:00'
```

**IMPORTANT: the weather and outdoor_sensor are not required, but you need one of them if you want to use this function, if not remove them**

### Example Window/Door - Sensor config

```yaml
livingroom_windows:
  name: Livingroom Windows
  icon: mdi:window-open-variant
  all: false
  entities:
    - binary_sensor.openclose_1
    - binary_sensor.openclose_2
    - binary_sensor.openclose_3
```

### Combine multiple TRV to one

Install the HACS [climate_group](https://github.com/daenny/climate_group) from @daenny

As each TRV has an individual local_temperature and must be individually calibrated, you need to create a better_thermostat entity for each TRV and then group them:

Example:

```yaml
climate:
  - platform: better_thermostat
    name: Ai - TRV - Office - 1
    thermostat: climate.real_trv_office_1
    temperature_sensor: sensor.temperatur_office_temperature
    window_sensors: group.office_windows
    weather: weather.home
    off_temperature: 19.5
    unique_id: 1
  - platform: better_thermostat
    name: Ai - TRV - Office - 2
    thermostat: climate.real_trv_office_2
    temperature_sensor: sensor.temperatur_office_temperature
    window_sensors: group.office_windows
    weather: weather.home
    off_temperature: 19.5
    unique_id: 2
  - platform: climate_group
    name: "TRV - Office"
    temperature_unit: C
    entities:
      - climate.ai_trv_office_1
      - climate.ai_trv_office_2
```
