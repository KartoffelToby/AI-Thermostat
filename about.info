This custom component for Home Assistant will add crucial features to your climate-controlling TRV (Thermostatic radiator valves) to save
you the work to create automations to make it smart. It combines a room-temperature sensor, window/door sensors, weather forecasts, or an
ambient temperature probe to decide when it should call for heat and automatically calibrate your TRVs to fix the imprecise measurements
taken in the radiator's vicinity.
